## Project Overview

This project focused on developing a natural language processing system capable of analyzing financial documents such as annual reports, earnings calls, and regulatory filings. The system automatically extracts key information, categorizes it, and identifies trends that might be of interest to investors and analysts.

## Technical Approach

The solution combines several NLP techniques:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying companies, people, and financial figures
- Sentiment analysis for gauging market perception
- Topic modeling for categorizing document sections
- Information extraction for structured data output

The system was implemented using spaCy for NLP processing and TensorFlow for custom model training. The results are presented through an intuitive web interface built with SvelteKit.

## Impact

This tool has significantly reduced the time analysts spend reading through lengthy financial documents, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities like strategy development and client interaction.
