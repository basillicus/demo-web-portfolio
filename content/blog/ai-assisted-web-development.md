# AI-Assisted Web Development: Building a Portfolio with Qwen Code

In this post, I'll share my experience collaborating with Qwen Code, an AI coding assistant, to build my professional portfolio website. This isn't just about using AI to write codeâ€”it's about exploring a new paradigm of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## The Starting Point

The project began with two key documents that would serve as the foundation for our collaboration:

1. **DESIGN.md** - Outlining the design philosophy and principles
2. **PROMPT.md** - Serving as the technical blueprint and requirements specification

These documents established clear guidelines for the project:
- An elegant, professional, content-first design
- Modern technical stack (SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Focus on accessibility and responsive design
- Static site generation for performance and simplicity

## The Collaborative Process

Working with Qwen Code was unlike traditional development. Rather than writing code myself, I guided the process by:

1. **Providing clear specifications** through the design documents
2. **Reviewing and iterating** on the generated code
3. **Making decisions** on design and implementation details
4. **Testing and refining** the functionality

Qwen Code demonstrated remarkable capabilities:
- Understanding complex design requirements
- Implementing sophisticated features like font theme switching
- Maintaining consistency with the established design system
- Following best practices for modern web development

## Key Features Implemented

### Font Theme System
One of the most interesting features we built was a font theme switcher that allows users to choose between standard and accessibility-optimized fonts. This required:

- Integrating multiple font families from Google Fonts
- Creating CSS custom properties for theme management
- Building a user interface for switching themes
- Implementing local storage persistence

### Responsive Design
The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive navigation that switches between desktop and mobile layouts
- Flexible grid systems for content display

### Dark/Light Theme Support
We implemented a comprehensive theme system that:
- Supports both dark and light modes
- Maintains user preferences across sessions
- Adapts all UI elements to the selected theme

## The Development Workflow

The collaboration followed an iterative pattern:
1. I would describe a feature or improvement
2. Qwen Code would implement it with detailed explanations
3. I would review, test, and provide feedback
4. We would iterate until the feature met requirements

This process was surprisingly efficient. Rather than spending time on implementation details, I could focus on higher-level architectural decisions and user experience considerations.

## Benefits of AI-Assisted Development

### Speed and Efficiency
Features that might have taken days to implement were completed in hours. The AI's ability to understand requirements and generate correct code quickly accelerated development.

### Consistency
With a clear design specification, Qwen Code maintained consistency throughout the codebase, following established patterns and conventions.

### Learning Opportunity
Working alongside an AI provided insights into modern development practices and approaches I might not have considered.

### Reduced Cognitive Load
I could focus on design and user experience rather than getting bogged down in implementation details.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Review and Oversight
While the generated code was generally high quality, human review remained essential for:
- Ensuring requirements were correctly understood
- Maintaining security best practices
- Verifying accessibility compliance
- Optimizing performance

### Creative Input
Some aspects of development still benefit from human creativity and intuition, particularly around user experience and design decisions.

## Deployment and Hosting

The website is built as a static site using SvelteKit's adapter-static, making it deployable to any static hosting platform. We explored several options including Vercel, Netlify, and traditional web hosts.

## Conclusion

This collaboration with Qwen Code demonstrated the potential of AI-assisted development. Rather than replacing developers, AI tools like Qwen Code can amplify human creativity and productivity by handling the implementation details while developers focus on design, architecture, and user experience.

The resulting portfolio website is a testament to what's possible when human expertise and AI capabilities work together. It's professional, accessible, and showcases both the technical content and the development process.

As AI tools continue to evolve, I believe we're entering a new era of software development where the most effective teams will be human-AI collaborations, each contributing their unique strengths to create better software.

Would you consider using AI-assisted development for your next project? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments below.
