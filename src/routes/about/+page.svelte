			<p class="text-xl mb-8">
				I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer and AI Researcher with over 5 years of experience 
				developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Professional Background</h2>
			<p>
				I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence 
				from Stanford University. My career began at a fintech startup where I developed fraud detection 
				algorithms that reduced fraudulent transactions by 35%.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I later joined a leading tech company where I worked on natural language processing systems 
				for customer service automation, helping to reduce response times by 60% while maintaining 
				high customer satisfaction scores.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Technical Expertise</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Machine Learning & Deep Learning</li>
				<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
				<li>Computer Vision</li>
				<li>Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch</li>
				<li>Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP)</li>
				<li>Data Engineering & MLOps</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				I believe that technology should enhance human capabilities rather than replace them. 
				My work focuses on creating AI systems that are not only technically sound but also 
				ethically responsible and accessible to all.
			</p>
			
			<h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
			<p>
				You can find me hiking in the mountains, reading science fiction novels, or experimenting 
				with new recipes in the kitchen. I'm also an avid photographer and enjoy capturing the 
				beauty of the natural world through my lens.
